# A Neural Network written from scratch in Ruby

This is an experimental project as I build a simple feed forward Neural Network with backpropagation in Ruby in order to understand how neural networks work.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'neural_net'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install neural_net

## Usage

Load up `irb` and `require 'neural_net'`
Examples will be added as the project progresses
