# NeuralNet
### A simple neural network written from scratch in Ruby

This is an experimental project! What better way to learn all about neural networks than accept the simple task of building one from scratch? Because neural networks are really simple right?!

This project is still under development and should probably not be used for anything!

My aim is to build a simple neural net in nothing but pure ruby, that can be trained as an XOR gate.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'neural_net'
```

The neural net will then run a bunch of example code automatically once required

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install neural_net

## Usage

Load up `irb` and `require 'neural_net'`
Examples will be added as the project progresses

Currently only supports networks with a single output neuron, outputting a continuous value
